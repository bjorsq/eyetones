The project brings together ideas and techniques from electronic composition (James Tenney – *For Anne Rising*), process / gradual music (Steve Reich – *Pendulum Music*),  and takes ‘metaphysical’ inspiration from Charles Ives’ cosmic landscape, *The Unanswered Question*, to create a giant kinetic/architectural sound and light installation, celebrating the anomalous and disappearing final hour of BST, by transforming one of our most iconic landmarks into the world’s largest musical instrument.
