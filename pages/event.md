The Eye rotates anti-clockwise, effectively becoming a physical embodiment of the clocks ‘going back’, inviting us to meditate on the disparity between our human demarcation of time, in relation to it’s infinite and absolute nature, as we ‘listen’ to the final hour of British Summertime counting down to it’s end.

[Pioneering speaker design by Feonic technology](http://www.feonic.com/), simple installations that turn solid materials (eg. glass) into amplifiers, will transform the capsules of the London Eye into ‘sound emitting’ bodies, temporarily converting the Eye into a true musical instrument. Although the sound palate is minimal, and subject to a strict and systematic exposition, the piece manages to produce an engrossing, profound and emotive experience.

The notion of a ‘backwards-clock’ describing the clocks ‘going back’ is a simple and appealing concept, that should communicate well to a mainstream audience, potentially one much larger than currently exists for new music, and also link in to the ongoing and growing debate over the issue of clock-change.

In addition, the accompanying lighting display will provide a visual equivalent of the piece that will serve to enhance, describe and explain the musical content as it progresses.
